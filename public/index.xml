      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Mark Druffel!
I&amp;rsquo;m a data science neophyte, I mutate ‚òï + üç∫ into R code.
Motivation
Over the last 5 years I have found a passion for data analysis and software development. I set up this blog as a tool to reflect on what I learn during my journey and share it with the community. I hope the content will be useful to other newcomers and encourage collaboration. If you have any feedback or want to discuss any of the topics please feel free to reach out!</description>
