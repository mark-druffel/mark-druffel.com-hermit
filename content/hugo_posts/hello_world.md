At this year's RStudio Conf [David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org/) discussed the importance of sharing work publicly in his talk ["The unreasonable effectiveness of public work."](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-public-work). He attributed much of his own personal, professional success to the habit of sharing his work publicly and encouraged others to adopt the habit. I had been considering writing a blog for some time and attended the [Advanced RMarkdown Workshop](https://arm.rbind.io/) that week at the conference where I learned how to use the R package [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown). Now, 11 months later I'm finally publishing my first post :flushed: My goal is to develop the habit of using my blog in my daily workflow to capture what I learn to the benefit of my future self, and other aspiring data scientists.  

In light of David's talk inspiring me, I want to share his specific thoughts that stuck with me why I think they apply far beyond the blogosphere. 

## Why Blog 
David provided a useful programming analogy - any time you have provided the same in-person advice three times you should consider writing a blog post.

As a mostly self-taught data scientist, this really resonates with me. Blogs and online books like [UC Business Analytics R Programming Guide](https://uc-r.github.io/), [Aligned Left](https://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3), and [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) were the primary tools I used to get started. As I am learning concepts and developing my own ways of understanding, I think I have an obligation to the community to share in order to help other newcomers on their path.  

David went on to reference some of his own early misconceptions regarding the arc of providing meaningful work to the community:

In his earlier years he thought he had to do a lot of work before he could share it with the world, but he has come to the realization that sharing more frequently increases the value. He said, *"anything still on your computer is, to a first approximation useless. When I look back at grad school the things I did that ended up not being publicized and just stayed on my computer - even I've forgotten them."*

"Blogging is a way to teach & give advice that scales."

"If you're an academic, for every paper - turn it into a blog post."

"Blogging is one of the ways that I've most effectively improved my own communication skils."


Bad reasons (Outcomes - side effects)

Why spend time on public work? 

"Advance your career - build a public portfolio of your work and let other people know about your skills""

"Practicing good habbits - I find that public work builds particular habbits that you wouldn't build working in isolation."

"Contribute to the community - "


business world reasons...


open source and introspection...

A few weeks earlier, my team and I had run a study looking at the relationship between self-reflection and outcomes like happiness, stress and job satisfaction. 

.... 

The people who scored high on self-reflection were more stressed, depressed and anxious, less satisfied with their jobs and relationships, more self-absorbed, and they felt less in control of their lives. What’s more, these negative consequences seemed to increase the more they reflected.

Asking what could keep us open to discovering new information about ourselves, even if that information is negative or in conflict with our existing beliefs. Asking why might have the opposite effect.


At times, asking what instead of why can force us to name our emotions, a process that a strong body of research has shown to be effective. Evidence shows the simple act of translating our emotions into language — versus simply experiencing them — can stop our brains from activating our amygdala, the fight-or-flight command center. This, in turn, seems to help us stay in control.

However, there is one important exception to What Not Why. When you’re navigating business challenges or solving problems in your team or organization, asking why can be critical. For example, if a member of your team drops the ball on an important client project, not exploring why it happened means you risk recurrences of the problem. Or if a new product fails, you need to know the reason to ensure that your products are better in the future. A good rule of thumb, then, is that why questions are generally better to help us understand events in our environment and what questions are generally better to help us understand ourselves.
