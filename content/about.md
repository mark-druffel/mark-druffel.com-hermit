Hi, I'm Mark Druffel!  

I'm a data science neophyte, I `mutate` :coffee: + :beer: into [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) code. 

**Motivation**  
Over the last 5 years I have found a passion for data analysis and software development. I set up this blog as a tool to reflect on what I learn during my journey and share it with the community. I hope the content will be useful to other newcomers and encourage collaboration. If you have any feedback or want to discuss any of the topics please feel free to reach out!  

**Background**  
I grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio but I moved to Portland, Oregon by way of Chicago in 2017 where I live no with my wife and our two plants. I work at a boutique management consulting company, [Propeller](https://propellerconsulting.com/), where I help clients better leverage data in their organizations. The opinions on this site are my own and do not necessarily represent the views of Propeller or its employees.  

I graduated from Ohio University with a BBA and started my career in financial and IT audit :sleeping: After a few years I found myself transitioning into a role where I effectively managed a Business Intelligence team with virtually no background in analytics - I have been a data science neophyte ever since! In 2016 I doubled down on my new found passion and completed my Master's in Business Analysis at Notre Dame. I am the author of a few small R packages including [harvestR](https://github.com/propellerpdx/harvestR) & [bambooR](https://github.com/propellerpdx/bambooR) and like to talk anything data whenever I get the chance. I am also a sisyphean rock-climber, a cooking enthusiast, and love to travel!

-Mark
