## Intro  
At this year's RStudio Conf [David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org/) discussed the importance of sharing work publicly in his talk ["The unreasonable effectiveness of public work."](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-public-work). He attributed much of his own personal, professional success to the habit of sharing his work and encouraged others to adopt the habit. I had long considered writing a blog documenting much of my work. I attended the [Advanced RMarkdown Workshop](https://arm.rbind.io/)  at the conference and learned, among other things, the blogdown [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. I started a blog in the workshop, but put it down until now (11 months later) because my day job got in the way :flushed: My goal is to develop the habit of using my blog in my daily workflow to capture what I learn for the benefit of other aspiring data scientists and my future self.  

In light of that, I thought this first post I would reflect on David's talk to share specific points that stuck with me and why I believe that managing a blog to share your work is one of the most transformative changes a data scientist can make. 

## Why Blog? 
David provided a useful programming analogy:

```{r echo=F, message=F, warning=F, fig.align='center'}
blogdown::shortcode('tweet', '928447584712253440')
```

As a consumer of data science content, this advice really resonates with me. Blogs, books, and communities such as Stackoverflow, the [UC Business Analytics R Programming Guide](https://uc-r.github.io/), [Aligned Left](https://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3), and [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) were the primary tools I used to get started as a data scientist. As we leverage resources to learn concepts and develop our own shortcuts of understanding, I think we have an obligation to share with the community. It helps newcomers get up to speed more quickly and forces us to confront particular details we may not fully understand. Confronting these details helps us separate out what we do know from what we're still learning so we know where to focus. 

David went on to reference some of his own early misconceptions regarding the arc of providing meaningful work to the community:

[![](/posts/images/hello_world/goals.PNG){width=80% height=80%}](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jk7216yr30ztpdp/DavidRobinson-RStudio-2019-old.pdf?page=7)
 
In his earlier years, David thought that he needed to complete all steps in the above process before publishing (i.e. develop an idea, test it, document it, and get through the publishing process). In hindsight, he realized that publishing and collaboration was where he derived most of the value... with that in mind, why not share throughout the process? 
 
> Anything still on your computer is, to a first approximation useless. When I look back at grad school the things I did that ended up not being publicized and just stayed on my computer - even I've forgotten them.

This point cannot be overstated. Not only does writing help us to understand what we know more deeply, the documentation serves as a guide to our future selves when we encounter the same problem again.   

David went on to reference Philip Guo's advice for academics that... 

![](/posts/images/hello_world/philip_guo_tweet.PNG){width=80% height=80%}

Throughout my career, I have encountered issues within organizations that have existed for years, and yet are completely undocumented. Teams typically find workarounds to manage the specific issues and those workarounds simply exist as tribal knowledge. Teams frequently justify the lack of documentation with rationales such as "we're not going to waste time documenting a bug that will get fixed" or "you can't really document this it's just something you have to learn firsthand." Corporations tend to think of all documentation as technical documentation or user manuals, which often further discourages users from documenting and sharing. However, lightweight communication tools such as blogs and tweets would enable employees to efficiently and effectively share their experiences and learn from one other. This would save significant time and mitigate risk when senior leaders leave a team. Further, it would serve as requirements for the development teams who may need to make technology changes.  

The value of sharing extends beyond sharing what we've learned. David referenced a simple function he wrote to extract the coefficients from linear model and put them into a data frame. This simple function became an integral package within the tidyverse's modeling ecosystem, [broom](https://github.com/tidymodels/broom). If David had not shared that early prototype hundreds of R users would still grapple with the clunky exercise of extracting data from the models they build for interpretation. The value delivered by sharing this work had a widespread impact across the R community. Regarding his experience with broom, David said:  

> When you contribute to the community, you'll find the community contributes back. 

When you build a tool that others find useful, they won't just use it... they will contribute by iterating over it and extending it. Open-source is a powerful idea within software development. The data science community relies on open-source for growth and, given their close relationships with non-technical teams, they can help their non-technical business partners understand and leverage blogging and open-sourcing to benefit their communities as well. I personally have inherited dozens of 100MB Excel workbooks that take hours upon hours to decode. Imagine how much time business users could save by simply saving their thoughts during the process of building these workbooks. I sometimes find myself dreaming of business users checking in their  Excel workbooks on git when I hear an individual say they lost hours of work because they forgot to save a prior version of a workbook :sob:  

Hopefully these few anecdotes help demonstrate that sharing our work is beneficial to ourselves and the community as a whole. I'd encourage everyone to listen to [David's talk](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-public-work) as he covers this ideas more broadly and has more experience to bring to the conversation.

## How to blog? 
I am writing this blog in [Yihui Xie's](https://yihui.name/) [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package in R, with Github for continuous deployment, and Netlify for hosting. There are dozens of resources avialable to choose from, I've provided the resources I used below:

* [Up & Running with blogdown](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/)
* [Making a Website Using Blogdown, Hugo, and GitHub Pages](https://amber.rbind.io/2016/12/19/website/)
* [Rstudio Conf: Making Websites in R Markdown](https://arm.rbind.io/slides/blogdown.html#1)
* [blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)
* Setting up your blog with RStudio and blogdown:
    + [Part I: Creating the blog](http://estebanmoro.org/post/2019-02-02-setting-up-your-blog-with-rstudio-and-blogdown-i-creating-the-blog/)
    + [Part II: Workflow](http://estebanmoro.org/post/2019-02-01-setting-up-your-blog-with-rstudio-and-blogdown/)
    + [Part III: Modify Your Theme](http://estebanmoro.org/post/2019-02-04-setting-up-your-blog-with-rstudio-and-blogdown-iii-modify-your-theme/)
* [Markdown Basics](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html)
* [R Markdown the Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)

As a novice blogdown user, I'm not going to try to add to these resources at this point, but I will say that using Github for continous deployment has been a joy so far. I can make tiny tweaks to a post and push it to Netlify with one function call! The overall process with blogdown is pretty painless although everything is still a little "black boxy" because I have not found any extensive blogdown resources using the template I chose. That being said, tt only took a few minutes to have the template up and running. Once the template is up, you can simply make modifications and continuously release changes. 

## My List of DS Blogs & Twitter Accounts
In light of this discussion, I decided to go through my bookmarks bar to pull out data science blogs I've found useful over the years and include corresponding Twitter accounts. Twitter has been an incredible resource for me over the last two years keeping up with new package releases, finding links to useful content, and learning about opportunities to meet other data scientists (e.g. conferences, unconferences, etc.). I tried to focus on practical blogs with examples in code - these resources have been my sherpa for the last few years. The list is somewhat R-centric because R is the #1 tool in my data science toolbelt. However, there are a few resources focused on `D3.js`, `python`, and others.  

```{r echo=F, error=F, message=F}
list <- readxl::read_excel(paste0(here::here(),'/content/posts/data/hello_world/list_of_blogs.xlsx'))
dt_list <- list %>% 
  dplyr::select(Person_Org,Category,Tech_Focus,Twitter_Handle,URL) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(Person_Org) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(Twitter = dplyr::if_else(
                          is.na(Twitter_Handle)==F,
                          paste0('<a href=\"https://twitter.com/',Twitter_Handle,'\">',Twitter_Handle,'</a>'),
                          ''),
                Person_Org = dplyr::if_else(
                          is.na(URL)==F,
                          paste0('<a href=\"',URL,'\">',Person_Org,'</a>'),
                          '')) %>% 
  dplyr::select(Person_Org,Twitter,Tech_Focus) %>% 
  dplyr::rename('Person / Org Website'='Person_Org','Languages'='Tech_Focus') %>% 
  dplyr::select(`Person / Org Website`, Twitter)
dt_table <- DT::datatable(dt_list, escape = F)
css_sheet <- 'datatable_hugoHermet.css'
invisible(file.copy(from=paste0(here::here(),'/content/posts/css/hello_world/',css_sheet),to=paste0(dt_table$dependencies[[1]]$src$file ,'/css/',css_sheet),overwrite = T))
dt_table$dependencies[[1]]$stylesheet[1] <- 'css/datatable_hugoHermet.css'
dt_table$dependencies[[1]]$stylesheet[2] <- 'css/datatable_hugoHermet.css'  
dt_table 
```

**Notes:**  
* The [bookdown archive](https://bookdown.org/home/archive/) is a list of bookdown sites RStudio maintains. That is a goldmine of information. For those new to R I highly recommend starting with [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).  
* [Mark Sellors' Blogdown List](https://awesome-blogdown.com/) is a list of blogs made with blogdown that anyone can add to on Github.
